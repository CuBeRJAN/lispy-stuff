# lispy-stuff
A collection of some useful CL functions and macros, made for use with SBCL

* Depends on asdf and uiop, usually provided by most Common Lisp implementations
* Written specifically for use with SBCL, with small adjustments portable
* Uses tail call recursion - TCO required!
* Some macros are taken from Clojure
